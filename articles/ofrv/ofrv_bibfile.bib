abstract = "In analyzing neural data, we often have to deal with quantities that fluctuate randomly in time. For example, an intracellular recording of the membrane potential of a neuron in vivo or a sequence of extracellular action potentials. Variables that fluctuate randomly in time are called stochastic processes or random functions. In this chapter, we define two types of stochastic processes that are used, respectively, to describe continuous variables, such as random potential fluctuations, and events, like random sequences of action potentials. We have already encountered the simplest such process in previous chapters in the form of the homogeneous Poisson and gamma renewal processes. Next, we introduce some of the tools used to study the properties of stochastic processes. In particular, we will see that the Fourier transform allows us to characterize the frequency content of stochastic processes through spectral analysis."

abstract="As mentioned in the introduction to this volume, the purpose of the formation was mainly to provide an in-depth presentation of stochastic processes as modelling tools. The chosen standpoint is thus a physical point of view. However, it has also been emphasised that, in order to be able to follow the details of specific models and build bridges between different subjects where new ideas related to stochastic modelling can appear, researchers must have a sound knowledge of the mathematical properties of stochastic processes. This represents a middle-of-the-road approach. Indeed, even though the subject is still relatively young, a vast mathematical literature exists on stochastic processes (Arnold, 1974; Klebaner, 1998; Oksendal, 1995; Karatzas and Shreve, 1991) but these works may not be easily accessible to physically-oriented readers. On the other hand, stochastic processes have been used in separated fields of Applied Physics but not always with a clear presentation or resorting to some `recipes'. Yet, in recent decades, attempts have been made to come up with improved introductions to stochastic processes in the Physics community.",
